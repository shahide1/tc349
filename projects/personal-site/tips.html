    <h2>Options Introduction</h2>
    <p>Options are different vehicles used by investors and traders to trade the markets.  There are many incentives to using options, including:
    <ul>
	<li>Less expensive way to gain exposure to markets</li>
	<li>Higher risk/higher reward aspect</li>
	<li>Fast paced realization of gains</li>
	<li>Matched liquidity to underlying stock</li>
	</ul>
    These aspects of option trading has provided the retail investor the opportunity to profit from consistent moves in the markets.  However, one must be cautious when using options because the potential for losses is also great.</p>
    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>With options, one can either go 'long' or 'short' the underlying stock via using calls and puts, respectively.  If one buys a call, then they make money if the stock goes up.  Conversely, if they buy a put, then they make money if the stock goes down.  Furthermore, options expire, and there are different expiration sets which that expire at different times which are available to the investor.</p>
    <p>The main constituents in option trading are underlying stock price, implied volatility, and time.  Options are decaying assets in that they lose value over time.  Addtionally, option premium is calculated based on the actual stock's price as well as the implied volatility, or IV.  The IV is determined by investor sentiment on an upcoming significant stock move.  The higher the IV, the higher the price of the options.</p>
    <h2>Things to watch out for</h2>
    <p>There are multiple ways one can purchase options.  They can either <em>buy</em> calls or puts, or they can <em>sell</em> calls or puts. </p>
    <p>Buying calls or puts means that the initial principal put at risk is the total amount one can lose.  This is beneficial because the investor has defined risk.  However, selling calls or puts (when opening a position) means that the investor is borrowing margin equity from their broker.  The potential for losses using this method is much greater.<p>
    <p>Because of the higher risks involve with options, we advise all of our followers to use stops at the defined risk prices.  This takes the emotional part of the 'game' out, and ensures the trader can only lose what they are willing to.</p>
    <p>In order to be a successful options trader, one must have a great knowledge of options.  Furthermore, they must practice patience, gain knowledge, and have always have a pre-determined plan.</p>
