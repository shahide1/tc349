Cnbc.com is a website I visit often on my mobile device, and fortunately they have a mobile version of their regular website.  I must disclose that many mobile versions of certain websites are implemented terribly, and therefore when I have the option, I choose to view the regular version of those sites.  However, with cnbc.com’s mobile website, I gladly use their mobile version.
The mobile site has all of the content neatly organized and well formatted so that everything fits on the screen properly and is easy to navigate.  The mobile site operates with all of the features and tools as the regular site, which I am very appreciative of.  They continue to have their breaking news updates in the header, a list of five top story links on the home page with the ability to view more top stories on a separate page, a video section and a real-time quotes search box.  I use all of these features regularly on their website, so the fact that they are all still available on the mobile site keeps me satisfied.
Overall, cnbc.com’s mobile website is very well done.  The fact that it is formatted correctly, user friendly, and has all of the content provided on their original site makes cnbc.com mobile great.
