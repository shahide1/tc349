       I have chosen Adobe’s Dreamweaver for my development environment.  The main reason I choose Dreamweaver (DW) over other similar IDE’s, such as Visual Studio, is because DW has most or all of the features/components in its environment that other comparable IDE’s have.  Some of these are a coding and design area (where you can code and then see the results of your code in the design window), various windows and toolbars to help with the design and development processes, and a overall easy-to-use design.	
       Another major reason why I chose DW is because I already have it installed on my machine.  This way, I didn’t have to spend any money on another IDE product.  Although I have DW already on my machine, I actually have never used it.  I wanted to try a new IDE aside from Visual Studio (which I also have) in order to give me more experience with developing in multiple IDE platforms.  I look forward to seeing what else DW has to offer.
