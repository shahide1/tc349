I think that "www.jasonsantamaria.com" is a very well designed website.  Its layout is simple, yet effective in providing an exceptional user experience.  This is because the site provides a clean, presentable design to the user along with tons of content and information about Jason Santa Maria and his opinions.  For the amount of articles, links, blogs, books, and personal information Santa Maria has on his site, I found it very easy to navigate while remaining entertained.

One thing that drives me crazy about newer websites is when a certain page on the site reads 'Coming Soon' or equivalent, letting the user know that the page is being worked on and will be available at a later time.  That's it.  This occurs on Santa Maria's new site in the "Portfolio" page.  However, what is different and better about Santa Maria's site is that on this page, he provides a link to his previous site where the user can view his portofolio of work.  This way, the user isn't left hanging.  Just because Santa Maria isn't done with the portfolio page on his new site, why should the users be left in the dark about his work?  A good web designer, in my opinion, never has an area on their website that is 'dead' or 'incomplete'.  

I really appreciated Mr. Santa Maria's simple use of a link to his old site's portfolio page.  I was genuinely interested in seeing what projects he had worked on, and was glad that he provided a link to his old site so that I could view them.

Overall, I believe that www.jasonsantamaria.com is a well designed website because it is well organized, professionally designed, has plenty of relative content (sans 'clutter'), and is easy to navigate.
