I’d like to start my critique of Happycog.com by saying that this website is very user friendly, which is probably what I like the most about it.  The website’s use of colors (but not too many), images, graphic designs (such as their logo) and overall inviting content makes me as the user feel right at home.  By ‘right at home’ I mean it is easy to navigate and I was genuinely interested in the content on their website.  Many sites who advertise their services tend to make their pages cluttered with content and images.  This tends to overwhelm me (and I’m sure most users too), leading to their website being exited rather quickly.  This is not the case with Happycog.com. 
One of the best features of Happycog.com is that they have most of their content on the home page.  All of their different content is divided into sections on the home page, which can easily be navigated to via the menu navigation buttons.  Additionally, they keep the menu bar with navigation buttons displayed in the header at all times, no matter where you are in the home page.  So if you are toward the bottom in their ‘Network’ section and want to go back to the top to their ‘Work’ section, it’s still a simple click away.  However, when it is necessary to have a different page that requires more content (such as with the ‘contact us’ page), they do it.   It is obvious that Happycog.com knows how to organize their information and content well, hence providing a more flowing and smooth feel to their site.
