Etsy.com Critique
Etsy.com is a well designed website which provides a ‘handmade’ marketplace to their users, emphasizing on small business marketing.  They use CSS padding and margins to pleasantly divide and space out their site, which makes it more aesthetically pleasing.  Furthermore, Etsy.com uses different sections assisting the user in finding an item they might like, as well as ‘clickable’ images that lead to a more informational page about the product they are marketing.  One bad aspect of this site is that they do not provide a clear link to their ‘about’ page. 
The different sections of the etsy.com homepage I found helpful will browsing their advertised products.  I enjoyed seeing what they personally like in their ‘handpicked’ section.  Seeing what the people behind the site like made me feel that much more comfortable in liking it to.  I guess that’s just human nature.  Additionally, etsy.com has a ‘Related to This Item You’ve Viewed’ section which displays images of other items related to the previous item I viewed.  This assisted me in finding other products of the same design, content and nature which I might enjoy better.  Finally, being able to click on the images of the products being marketed and then being directed to a new page that describes the product in more detail was very helpful in selling the item to me.  Any site trying to sell products should use this method if they want to be successful.
I was not impressed with the fact that etsy.com did not provide an obvious link to their ‘about’ page.  I had to scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page to find it in the footer, with very small font-size might I add.  Etsy.dot pitches to their customers that they ‘handpick’ items that they like in hopes that you will like it to and purchase it.  Wouldn’t their users want to know more about the people and site who are handpicking these items?  I know I did, and it wasn’t that easy to find out.
