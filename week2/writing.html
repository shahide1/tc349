    <h3>Panic.com Critique</h3>
    <h2>
    <p>The website, Panic.com, is a very interesting site that offers applications for Apple based products, such as the iPhone, Mac computer, and iPad tablet.  Upon initially entering the site, I found that the header image took quite a bid of time to load, which I was not impressed by.  This was the case when navigating throughout the site to other pages, such as on their specific app description pages.  This makes the site less fluid and can be annoying to have to wait for images to load all the time.
 	</p>
    <p>Panic.com does have a colorful and image friendly website, while remaining simple, and easy to navigate.  The provide five well-designed, image links to pages with information about their applications.  Upon hovering over one of these images, the name and a short description about their products is revealed.  I found that this was helpful in knowing a little bit about where I was going to be navigated to before I actually arrived there.
    </p>
    <p>The site also features a link to their blog, as well as to a page advertising t-shirts that they make.  I think that this type of content on a website helps the user feel get on a more personal level with the people behind the website, where they can read the website creator's blogs and see additional products that they provide.
    </p>
    <p>I found the pages that describe their apps to be very informational and helpful.  They have step-by-step instructions on how to download their applications, and they even provide a frequently asked questions page!  Furthermore, they provide a link to the App Store where you can purchase your their products.  Providing this link right on the description and instructional page of the apps is very important as it ensures that the user knows where to go and is only a click a way from purchasing their product.
    </p>
    <p>Overall, I thought this was a good website with the minor set back that some of their images take too long to load.  After visting this site, I actually would like to try out some of their products!
