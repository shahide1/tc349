Michigan State University’s mobile website truly surprised me by how well-implemented and user friendly it is.  I was also surprised that I did not know about it until now.  First off, the way that the home page utilizes icons, along with accompanying captions, in a simple and non-overwhelming fashion is a great way to welcome the user to the site.  Most of the pages that the icon menus lead to are also well organized and very informational; when relevant, the site provides a search bar to help the user find what they are looking for.  I found that the use of this search bar was not only helpful, but reliable.  I also really enjoyed the ability to customize the home page with whatever icons I want, or don’t want, available—this feature gave me a sense of control over the site, making it more personable and therefore appealing.
One of the menus on the homepage was the Video icon.  I was initially skeptical when first navigating to the video section of the site, fearing that it would be slow, poorly organized, and confusing.  I was wrong.  This section provided a thumbnail of the video along with a descriptive caption.  I could very easily scroll through the videos and locate any content I was interested in.  In addition, the home page provided a link to the full MSU  (non mobile) version of the site, another convenience provided to the user.
One aspect of this site that I did not like was the About MSU section.  Some of the pages in this section, such as Academics and Engagement, use an image at the top of the page followed by content.  This image is somewhat poorly formatted—it is partially cut off on the right-hand side of the page.  Although nothing major, I found it annoying that I couldn’t view the entire image, and it also gave the page an overall sloppy look to it.
Overall, I thought that MSU’s mobile site was great.  It was helpful, concise, easy to navigate, and very informational.  I will be using this site a lot more in the future.
